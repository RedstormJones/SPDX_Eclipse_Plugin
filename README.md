SPDX Eclipse Plugin
===================

System Overview
---------------

Partnered with the [University of Nebraska at Omaha](http://www.unomaha.edu/), an [Eclipse](https://eclipse.org/home/index.php) plugin is being developed which will allow developers to easily view licensing and copyright information for individual software files or projects in the format of [SPDX](https://spdx.org/) documents. The plugin will maintain the SPDX documents by utilizing local installations of [DoSOCS](https://github.com/socs-dev-env/DoSOCS) and [FOSSology](http://www.fossology.org/projects/fossology).
