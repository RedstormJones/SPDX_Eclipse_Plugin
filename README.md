SPDX Eclipse Plugin
===================

System Overview
---------------

Partnered with the [University of Nebraska at Omaha](http://www.unomaha.edu/), a new plugin is being developed for the [Eclipse](https://eclipse.org/home/index.php) integrated development environment.

Building on existing functionality offered by the [FOSSology+SPDX](https://spdx.org/tools/community/fossologyspdx) application, this Eclipse plugin will first allow developers to easily view licensing and copyright information of selected software files (FOSSology functionality). Developers may then use the plugin to either add licensing and copyright information or to generate SPDX files (FOSSology and SPDX functionality) which are standardized documents that compile licensing and copyright information, for appropriate software files.
